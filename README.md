# bitcoin_trend_predictor

## In this project, I am using the coinmarket API to look for patterns to create an intelligent BTC trend predictor
Examples of questions I would like to answer:
How many times does BTC drop 1% a minute, hour, day, week, month ..., 2% , 3%........25%
How long does BTC stay in a short term up trend, short term down trend, how long does it stay in medium term up trend, medium down trend, how long it flatters ...etc
What effect does BTC have on the top Alt Coin, when BTC drops or jumps, how does this effect the Alt Coins
